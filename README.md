work on as rigid as possible shape deformation -- will become an addon soon... this a staging ground for work.

this code is based on this example:

w/ some reworking to work against ofMesh (specifically, a triangle mesh with indices).   I'm trying to remove as much of the WML as possible and speed up the constraint solving which is fairly slow on big meshes.
